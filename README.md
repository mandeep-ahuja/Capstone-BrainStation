# Decoding Market Sentiments: Leveraging Machine Learning to Predict Bitcoin Trends from Social Media Data

## Project Overview
This project aims to explore the potential of machine learning in predicting Bitcoin trends using social media data, specifically analyzing over 22 million tweets. The focus is on understanding the relationship between public sentiment expressed in tweets and the fluctuations in Bitcoin prices.

## Contents
- Notebook #1 `Mandeep_Ahuja_Notebook_1_Capstone_Word2Vec`: Notebook includes an end-to-end project, applying Word2Vec for natural language processing on #Bitcoin data.
- Notebook #2 `Mandeep_Ahuja_Notebook_2_Capstone_TweetEval_Pre_training`: Notebook includes an end-to-end project, multiple model pre-training using TweetEval and modeling on #Bitcoin dataset using RoBERTa.

## Data Source
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and includes over 22 million tweets related to Bitcoin, spanning 2021-2022.
